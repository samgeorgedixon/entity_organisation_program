#  Introduction

Welcome to the Entity Organisation Program's documentation.

## Overview
The Entity Organisation Program can be used to organise a variety of things like people into into a range of different things like seats.

It can be used heavily in areas involving organising groups of people of a range of sizes based off conditions and zoning.

For instance it can be used for creating seating plans of people in an array of rooms or timetables for large arrangements of people in a work place, school or event.

## Getting Started

To get started you can download the installer and the template or an example from the [releases](https://github.com/samgeorgedixon/entity_organisation_program/releases) page.

It is all based around a spreadsheet that you configure based on the type of lua config which defines how the spreadsheet is interpreted and ran through the program into another spreadsheet with the evaluated results inside.
