#  Introduction

Welcome to the Entity Organisation Program's documentation.

## Overview
The Entity Organisation Program can be used to organise a variety of things like people into into a range of different things like seats.

It can be used heavily in areas involving organising groups of people of a range of sizes based of conditions and zoning.

For instance it can be used for creating seating plans of people in an array of rooms or timetables for large arrangements of people in a work place, school or event.

## Getting Started

To get started you can download the installer and the template or an example from the [releases](https://github.com/samgeorgedixon/entity_organisation_program/releases) page.

It is all based around an "Excel Workbook (*.xlsx)" that you configure and run through the program outputting another workbook with the evaluated results inside.

Next you will need to configure this file and run it, here is how to do that.
